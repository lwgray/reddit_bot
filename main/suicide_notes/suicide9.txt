I'm sorry to those who i offended over the years.  I'm blind to see that I, as a human being, suck.  I'm an individual who is doing an injustice to the world and it's time for me to leave.  Please don't ever feel sorry for me or cry - because i had an opportunity at life and that opportunity is over. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to love someone or have someone love me.  I guess it's best though, because now I leave no pain onto anyone.  The kids in school are right, I am a loser, a freak, and a gag and in no ways is that acceptable for people to deal with.  I'm sorry for not being a person that would make someone proud.

I'm free now. Xoxo
