Mommie, my Darling,
To love you as I do and live without you is more than I can bear. I love you so completely, wholeheartedly without restraint. I worship you, that is my fault. With your indifference to me; is the difference. I’ve tried so hard to make our lives pleasant and lovable, but you didn’t seem to care. You had great plans which didn’t include me. You didn’t respect me. That was the trouble. You treated me like a child. I couldn’t reach you as a man and woman or man and wife as we’ve lived. I let you know my feelings toward you when I shouldn’t have. How I loved you, what you meant to me. Without you life is unbearable.
This is the best way. This will solve all our problems. You can’t hurt me further and anyone else. I was a “toll” while you needed me or thought you did. But now that I could use some help, you won’t supply the need that was prominent when you need it. So, good bye my love. If it is possible to love in the hereafter, I will love you even after death. May God have mercy on both our souls. He alone knows my heartache and sorrow and love for you.
Daddy
