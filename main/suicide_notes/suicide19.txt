Dear Mother & Dad,
Please forgive me. I have tried to be good to you both. I love you both very much and wanted to get along with you both. I have tried. I have wanted to go out with you and Dad but I was always afraid to ask for I always felt that the answer would be no.
And about Bud, I want to dismiss every idea about him. I don’t like him any more than a companion, for a while I thought I did but no more, in fact, I am quite tired of him, as you know, I get tired of everyone after a while.
And mother, I wish that you hadn’t called me a liar, and said I was just like Hap. as I’m not. It is just that I am afraid of you both at times, but I love you both very much.
So Long,
Your loving daughter
that will always
love you,
Mary
P.S. Please forgive me. I want you to, and don’t think for one minute that I haven’t appreciate everything you’ve done.
