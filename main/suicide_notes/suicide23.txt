To No-one and Everyone:
Because of a growing conviction that a hereditary insanity is manifesting itself beyond my control, I am taking this way out — before mere nuisance attacks and rages against others assume a more dangerous form.
Because I am an agnostic and believe funeral fanfare to be nonsense — I ask that it be forgotten. Instead, knowing there to be a marked shortage of cadavers for the medical profession, for which I have endless respect, I hereby bequeath 1) my body to medics for dissection; also 2) To Mark B. all personal effects — to be divided as whim decrees — with Dr. Lois J., L.A. and to each — a deep fondness and love. 3) To Joe A. the greatest devotion — the kind that “passeth all understanding.” 3a) And my life.
