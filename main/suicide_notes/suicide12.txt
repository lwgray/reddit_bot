What is a few short years to live in hell. That is all I get around here.
No more I will pay the bills.
No more I will drive the car.
No more I will wash, iron & mend any clothes.
No more I will have to eat the leftover articles that was cooked the day before.
This is no way to live.
Either is it any way to die.
Her grub I can not eat.
At night I can not sleep.
I married the wrong nag-nag-nag and I lost my life.

To the undertaker:
We have got plenty money to give me a decent burial. Donâ€™t let my wife kid you by saying she has not got any money.
Give this note to the cops.
Give me liberty or give me death.
